work in progress. anycubic kobra v1 with creality sprite pro extruder and hot end, bl touch, (fil det on the way), (..perhaps the stock screen if usable),Y axis has been removed, drilled 
4 new holes closer to the front of the machine(12mm forward) for the offset of the new extruder, a case was sorced to use but i will change in the future i do not like the cable managemnt 
or how tight the board fan is to all the wires, added Dual z mod with nema 17 28 steepers from .... not ldo, mostly new wiring to each stepper (very painful) set to use sensorless homing ,
bed screws (not accurate at this time) i have not finised distance testing for any of the steppers at this time.

This is my latest iteration of the anycubic project i have been working on to klipperize. It started with some stuff from the orignal board,hardware and evolved to what is listed above.
WORK IN PROGRESS I HAVE NOT MADE THE FIRST PRINT AS OF YET (2/20/24). i am migrating my workstations an using get as a backup.
